# Agent guide

`santi` is a standalone agent runtime. Treat this repo as runtime-first: there
is no product layer here, and none should be added speculatively.

## Layout

```text
crates/
  api/             # the `santi-api` binary: config, bootstrap, serve, local ops
  santi-core/      # runtime model + service (turns, assembly, objects, workspace)
  santi-estate/    # Keel graph + durable ceremonies and projections
  santi-provider/  # ProviderClient boundary; keeps santi-core provider-agnostic
  santi-api/       # HTTP/SSE/OpenAPI server library over santi-core
  santi/           # HTTP client plus an external-process operator namespace
    operator/       # retained operator-owned host/edge/deb assets and commands
docs/integration/v1/ # versioned owner contract and exact external-delivery assets
```

## Boundaries

- `santi-core` is provider-agnostic. Provider specifics live behind
  `santi-provider::ProviderClient`.
- `santi-api` is the only network boundary. Browser/host-facing shapes are
  owned here, not in `santi-core`.
- `api` ships `santi-api`, the server entry. It owns config resolution,
  bootstrap, serving, OpenAPI export, and local runtime operations.
- `santi` keeps its transport-only HTTP client boundary. Its explicit `operator`
  namespace may coordinate external binaries and owned assets, but must never
  depend on or call `santi-api` or `santi-core` in process. HTTP stays the only way in.

## Build & checks

```sh
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --workspace
```

CI (`.forgejo/workflows/guard.yml`) runs Ectropy syntax laws, Plumb repository
shape, and the Rust fmt/clippy/test triad on the self-hosted Linux runner.
Release workflows publish both executables in Linux x86_64 tar and Debian
artifacts to R2.

## Trigger a single turn locally (hot path)

To exercise a real end-to-end turn, prefer reusing the repo-root
`santi.toml` — it already configures a working provider, so no ad-hoc
config or env wiring is needed. `santi-api serve` reads `./santi.toml`
by default; drive one turn and stop when it lands:

```sh
santi-api serve &                                       # reads ./santi.toml
SID=$(santi strand create | jq -r .strand.id)
SANTI_STRAND_ID=$SID santi strand send 'Reply with exactly: OK' --watch
```

`--watch` follows the SSE stream and exits when the strand goes idle (after the
turn completes), so it doubles as the wait — no sleep/poll dance. It stays
robust when sends coalesce: a completed turn that spawns a follow-on is still
awaited to full idle. By default, watch output is filtered human-readable
milestones for interactive use.

For raw/debug automation, pass `--watch-format raw`; it relays event JSON (one
object per line, same payload shape as `strand events`). Distill the reply with
jq:

```sh
… strand send '…' --watch --watch-format raw \
  | jq -rc 'select(.payload.type=="message" and .payload.beat=="completed")
            | .payload.message.content_text'
```

`--strand`/`SANTI_STRAND_ID` set a default strand id; `--soul`/`SANTI_SOUL_ID`
pick a non-default soul (empty → the runtime's default soul; an unknown soul is
rejected, not silently created). To address a soul ad hoc without a default:
`santi --soul <id> strand send <strand_id> '…'`.

## Conventions

- Edition 2024, MIT. Workspace dependencies are pinned in the root
  `Cargo.toml`; crates reference them with `.workspace = true`.
- Forgejo (`PerishFire/santi`) is the canonical write target. The public GitHub
  repository is historical and is not reverse-synchronized.
- Santi's runtime boundary stops at its executables. Packaging, recovery, and
  system-service artifacts under `crates/santi/operator` are operator-owned and are not runtime
  architecture. Infra owns only generic host, k3s, DNS, and shared middleware.
- `docs/integration/v1/` is Santi-owned delivery truth. Its strict manifest binds one
  exact package release to pinned window assets, identity intent, and route
  semantics without generated IDs, credentials, or production endpoints.
  Consumers bind these tracked bytes through immutable commit URLs and exact
  SHA-256 plus byte-count identities; provisional live observations never amend
  the owner contract.
- Runtime secrets live in `santi.toml`; local release escrow lives under
  `.local/secrets/releases/`. Both are gitignored. Never commit live
  credentials; `santi.example.toml` is the tracked runtime template.

## Release

- Canonical-authority stable owns the root manager, moving pointer, default
  install root, and default bin directory. It is the only release admitted to
  those consensus surfaces.
- Every non-stable channel requires an exact version plus explicit install and
  bin paths disjoint from stable. Non-stable has no pointer or activation.
- `plumb.toml` is the product-owned release declaration. Stable Plumb owns
  target builds, archives, Debian assembly, managers and records, exact
  objects, public readback, and manager smoke.
- Publishing and stable activation use separate commands and credentials.
  Exact seals are create-only; stable activation compare-and-swaps the sole
  moving pointer.
- Stable is rebuilt from the same commit as one exact candidate and embeds its
  complete seal plus digest as proof.
- Live deploys require one exact beta. The host transaction resolves its Debian
  asset from that candidate's immutable seal.
- A stable release refuses to publish without
  `docs/CHANGELOG/v<version>/{en,zh}/{INDEX.md,MIGRATION.md}`, enforced by the
  stable capsule compiler before anything irreversible.
  `plumb doctor` does not check this: a changelog is owed by a release, not by a
  working tree. A release requiring nothing of anyone still writes MIGRATION.md
  saying so. See `plumb/docs/changelog.md`.
