# Santi service operations

This directory is the canonical source for Santi-specific cold operations. The infra repo owns the
generic host, DNS, k3s installation, and shared Authentik deployment; everything that names or
configures the Santi service lives here.

All commands run from the Santi repo root and use its gitignored `.local/ssh/config`.

## Cold host wiring

The Debian package creates the service account and runtime home. These idempotent scripts add the
estate-specific privileges and connect that account to its local k3s work surface:

```sh
for script in 00-host-preflight 10-santi-user 20-kube-access; do
  santi operator scp "crates/santi/operator/ops/host/${script}.sh" "hk-03.zxiyun:/tmp/${script}.sh"
  santi operator ssh hk-03.zxiyun -- bash "/tmp/${script}.sh"
done
```

## Authentik registration

The registration is idempotent. It creates or reuses the forward-domain provider/application, binds
it to the embedded outpost, and creates the CLI service account. Its printed `SANTI_AUTH_*` values
belong in this repo's local client config, never in git:

```sh
santi operator scp crates/santi/operator/ops/edge/register-authentik.sh \
  hk-03.zxiyun:/tmp/register-santi-authentik.sh
santi operator ssh hk-03.zxiyun -- sh /tmp/register-santi-authentik.sh
```

Pass `--rotate` to delete and recreate the app-password token. Capture the output directly into a
mode-600 local file, update `.local/secrets/santi.toml`, and delete the capture after the client
health check; do not print credentials into terminal or task logs.

## Edge apply

The namespace, ingress routes, window proxy, and current compatibility panel are applied from this
repo. ConfigMaps are regenerated idempotently and the Deployment is restarted explicitly because a
ConfigMap update does not roll pods by itself.

```sh
for file in ingress.yaml window.yaml; do
  santi operator scp "crates/santi/operator/ops/edge/${file}" "hk-03.zxiyun:/tmp/${file}"
done
for file in index.html nginx.conf; do
  santi operator scp "crates/santi/operator/ops/edge/resources/${file}" "hk-03.zxiyun:/tmp/${file}"
done

santi operator ssh hk-03.zxiyun -- 'k3s kubectl apply -f /tmp/ingress.yaml
k3s kubectl create configmap window-html -n santi --from-file=index.html=/tmp/index.html \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | k3s kubectl apply -f -
k3s kubectl create configmap window-nginx -n santi --from-file=default.conf=/tmp/nginx.conf \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | k3s kubectl apply -f -
k3s kubectl apply -f /tmp/window.yaml
k3s kubectl rollout restart deployment/window -n santi'
```

## Deploy recovery capsule

`santi operator deploy` first refuses to proceed while an earlier capsule is armed. Its streamed
host program verifies the installed source package, stops the service, snapshots the runtime,
installs the candidate, retains its package, and checks doctor, health, and memory continuity.
Failures after the stop boundary automatically restore the source package and runtime. After
readiness passes, the recovery program copies the raw snapshot and source/candidate packages into
`/home/santi/.santi/recovery/`, validates their identities and hashes, then atomically arms the
capsule. A deployment is not reported as complete until this succeeds.

```sh
santi operator rollback status
santi operator rollback execute <capsule-id> --confirm <candidate-package-version>
santi operator rollback accept <capsule-id>
```

`execute` stops the service before swapping runtime directories and reinstalling the source package.
If anything fails after that boundary, the service stays stopped and the candidate runtime remains
in the capsule for diagnosis, including state written after cutover. The restored source runtime is
the exact pre-deploy snapshot. Recovery never rolls the edge configuration back. `accept` requires a
healthy candidate and closes the rollback window without deleting the capsule. If post-deploy
capsule construction was interrupted, inspect `status`, then use `santi operator rollback repair` to
reconstruct it from the still-retained artifacts.

Dispatch releases through Forgejo and upgrade with `santi operator deploy`. Apply the edge
configuration separately; retired `/panel` routes intentionally stay absent so a runtime rollback
cannot resurrect the old embedded chat surface.

## Webhook subscriptions

Subscription topology is API-managed; signing values stay in the host's mode-600
`/etc/santi/santi.env`. Reconcile the non-secret desired state through the deployed HTTP client:

```sh
santi webhook ensure secretary \
  --adaptor github \
  --soul soul_default \
  --strategy per-thread \
  --credential SANTI_WEBHOOK_GITHUB_SECRET
santi webhook list
```

`ensure` creates an absent subscription, returns an identical one unchanged, and fails on drift. The
exact `/api/v1/webhooks` management collection remains behind Authentik; only event paths below
`/api/v1/webhooks/` bypass forward-auth and authenticate by provider signature.
